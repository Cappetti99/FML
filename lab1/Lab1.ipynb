This dataset consists of data about housing characteristics and prices in many districts of the state of California. The **task** this dataset asks us to solve is estimating the median house value in a district from a set of independent housing characteristics.\n",

    "The main objectives of this laboratory are:\n",
    "+ For you to gain familiarity with using Python for numerical programming in Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colaboratory, or *[INSERT TOOL OF CHOICE]*.\n",
    "+ For you to gain familiarity with working with data in Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.\n",
    "+ For you to learn how to use *visualization* as a tool for understanding the nature of machine learning problems and gain insight into potential solutions.\n",
    "+ To learn to use Scikit-learn to solve simple univariate regression problems and validate your solutions.\n",

This first version of the FML Laboratory Code of Conduct was developed in a brainstorming session with **ChatGPT Version 2**, modifying its proposal to the specifics of the FML Laboratories and concentrating on the transparent collaboration with classmates and transparent use of LLMs.\n",

    "#### **1. Transparency in LLM Use**\n",
    "- **Clear Disclosure:** Explicitly state when Large Language Models (LLMs) are used in any part of the process, including data analysis, code generation, or writing.\n",
    "- **Model Limitations:** Acknowledge the inherent limitations of LLMs, such as potential biases, and make clear where human intervention was applied to verify results or to modify/augment produced code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Proper Attribution and Documentation**\n",
    "- **Attribution:** Provide appropriate citations and credits for all external resources, including code, data, and models.\n",
    "- **Clear Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of tools, methods, and models used, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in your submitted laboratory solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Collaboration and Individual Work**\n",
    "- **Sharing Solutions:** While collaboration and discussing ideas with classmates are encouraged, solutions to assignments or projects should be your own. Do not copy or submit work created by others, including code or models, as your own.\n",
    "- **Submission Integrity:** All submitted work must reflect your own understanding and effort. If external tools, LLMs, online resources, or code from your classmates were used, they must be properly documented, but the final submission must be an individual effort.\n",
